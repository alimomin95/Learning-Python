This is a dice rolling simulator for use with the popular board game LUDO!

->This simple program uses the random integer generator to generate values between 1 and 6 to represent a roll of a dice.
->The program also keeps track of the sixes that are rolled and at the end prints all the values that were rolled (generated) for the user.
