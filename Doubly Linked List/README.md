This is my implementation of a Doubly Linked List

It features O(1) append to end of list, O(1) pops from left and right of the list and O(N) pop from given index.

It also is iterable and also contains string representation for easy printing.

Note: This code hasn't been tested extensively and might still contain bugs!
